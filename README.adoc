link:TODO.adoc[TODO]

== Requirements

- Java 17

You can use https://sdkman.io/ to easily switch between versions

== Run

    docker-compose up

Start application-sb-reactive and application-ui from the IDE or whatever method you prefer.

Swagger is available on http://localhost:8080/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html

== Build

The tests are using testcontainers on a fixed port for now so make sure you run `docker-compose down` before building.

Set includeUIinBackend to true in gradle.properties to include the UI in the backend jar if you want to run front and backend from a single jar.

    ./gradlew clean build

The jar will be available under application-sb-reactive/libs/application-sb-reactive-0.0.1.jar after building.

Run the jar with

    java -jar application-sb-reactive/build/libs/application-sb-reactive-0.0.1.jar

The application is now available on http://localhost:8080/
